function to get caloric goal
BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) – (5.677 x age in years)
first convert weight into kg 
0.453592kg per pound 

2.57 cm per inch

bmrMen = 88.362 + (13.397 * profile.weight * .4535) + (4.799 * profile.height * 2.57) - (5.677 * profile.age)

820.197
814.006
136
bmrWomen = 447.6 + (9.25 x weight * .4535) + (3.10 x height * 2.57) – (4.33 x age)



if goal is lose weight
caloric maintenance - 500
macros need research

FOR CUT
protein: 1.1-1.4 grams per bodyweight * 4 = calories

fats: 15-25% bmr/9 = grams

carbs: fill in the rest/4 = grams

GAINING
protein: 0.8-1.0 grams per pound * 4 = calories

fats: 20-30% of calories/9 = grams

carbs: fill in the rest/4 = grams

MAINTAIN
protein 25%
fats 25%
carbs 50%
